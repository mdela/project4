This is a simple project that demonstrates my understanding of database queries.

The program connects to my local database, creates a dataframe allocated with data extracted from that database, and graphs it onto a pie chart.
The pie chart shows the number of my friends living in each city.

Here is the sample data from the table:
| city          | residents |
|---------------|-----------|
| Glendale      | 1         |
| Koreatown     | 3         |
| Los Angeles   | 3         |
| Los Feliz     | 1         |
| Monterey Park | 1         |
| Santa Clarita | 1         |

Here is the output:
